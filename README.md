# DP-Conquest

## Unity Project
Created by Skyler Bistarkey-Rez, Marshall Naito, Arad Reed, Joel Zarley, and Jessie Lin for CS48. 

The player can be controlled using the arrow keys. The mini-games will occur when going to the houses. One house (at the door in the upper left corner house) currently starts a mini-game scene, but is blank with just a small back button. A car (enemy) also spawns randomly on occasion and drives on the road. If you get hit by it, it spins out (and should also increase your BAC when that is implemented).
