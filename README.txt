== Unity Project ==
Created by Skyler Bistarkey-Rez, Marshall Naito, Arad Reed, Joel Zarley, and Jessie Lin for CS48. 

== Building the Project ==
To build this project from the source code, it is required that you install Unity on your system.
1. Download and install Unity3D from this website: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download (this will take some time)
2. While installing, rename the "src" folder in "DP Conquest" to "Assets". This is because Unity wants the source files in a folder called "Assets" rather than "src"
3. Open Unity. On the start screen, select "Open" from the top right corner
4. Select the folder called "DP Conquest" and click the select folder button.
5. The Unity window should open. To build the game, select File->Build and Run from the drop down menu.
6. Follow the windows and prompts, and select a location to save the program.
7. The game should now run on your system.

Alternatively, it is HIGHLY recommended you do not install Unity to build the game, as this is very time and resource intensive.
For your convenience, we have included both Mac OSX and Windows files to the root directory, entitled "DPConquestWin.exe" and "DPConquestMac" respectively.
To play, simply click the file compatible with your operating system.

== Playing the game ==
When the game opens, you should be greeted with the title screen.
To begin playing, click the button labelled "Start the Conquest"
To exit at any time, click the red "X" in the top corner.
Once the game is loaded, you can control the character with the four arrow keys.
To trigger a mini-game scene, touch the door of the house in the top left.
To exit the not yet implemented mini-game, click the button labelled "DP Conquest"
Periodically, cars will come zooming down Del Playa Street.
Although you are supposed to avoid them, there is currently not any implemented penalty for car collision.
